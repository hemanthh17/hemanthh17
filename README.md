### Hi Hemanth Here <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="25px">
<div align="center">I am a 3rd year student of Electronics and Communications Engg and working as  <b>Freelance CV Researcher in Pzeros</b>. I was extremely fascinated towards Data Science after I took my first course in Machine and Deep Learning, after which I have been dedicatedly working on various small projects where automation is required. I also love participating in Hackathons and I am very active on Kaggle. I always love discussing and sharing my views with the Data Science community and I truly believe a career in this field is a marathon and everyday you get to learn new. It is not the destination but the journey that matters.
